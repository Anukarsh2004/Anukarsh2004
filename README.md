ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Anukarsh, a passionate software engineer and computer science student at the University of Waterloo. I have a strong foundation in Java, Python, C/C++, and JavaScript/TypeScript and experience with various frameworks like React, Node.js, and Next.js. I enjoy building scalable, efficient, and user-friendly applications, and I have a particular interest in web development, AI, and compiler development.

ðŸŒŸ Some of my recent projects include:

WLP4 Compiler: A compiler for WLP4, a restricted version of C, which involved parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation.
Travel Assist: A React-based search tool with an interactive Google Maps interface for discovering nearby hotels, restaurants, and attractions.
Chess in C++: A classic chess game implemented using the MVC design pattern with sub-classes for each chess piece.
ðŸ’¼ I'm also actively involved in co-op placements where I've gained hands-on experience in web development, automated testing, and infrastructure scalability. My most recent experience was at Propel Holdings Inc., where I contributed to UI revamps, performance optimization, and automated testing.

ðŸš€ Iâ€™m always eager to learn new technologies and take on challenging projects. When Iâ€™m not coding, I have a heavy interest in basketball, including data analytics, and enjoy exploring the latest trends in tech.

Let's connect and build something amazing together!
